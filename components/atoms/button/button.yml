notes: |
  Buttons are used for all main actions. The action they provide should always be self-explanatory, do only one thing and lead to what the user expects.

  You can add several classes to customize the button component:

  - `shadow-to-[right|left]`: adds a drop-shadow (you should decide which one to use depending on what side of the screen the button is at)
  - `active`: display the button in an active state
